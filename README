   UAKEH: USB Army Knife for Electronic Hacks

(AKA USB Army Knife for the Electronic Hobbyist)
*************************************************

WARNING: this project is in early development stage, and currently only an extremely
limited feature set is working.

IMPORTANT NOTE: this device will show up as a USB CDCACM peripheral. This means it
will communicate as a kind of serial port. Unfortunately Linux modem-manager
daemon misrecognize it as a modem, it tries to communicate with it, and it cause
serious problem. You have to disable modem manager or avoid it tries to use
our device as a modem. Otherwise nothing will work!

This is (the firmware for) a _fully_ open-source USB device for interfacing your
PC with embedded electronic devices through digital busses.

It might resemble the "bus-pirate" device for certain things but:
- It will _not_ use any third-party proprietary library,
- It will _not_ need any proprietary/closed-source compilers/IDE. It is compilable with
  GCC and a Linux box, and it can be flashed with OpenOCD and an homebrew JTAG interface
- It uses cheap, but quite powerful, ST Cortex-M3 ARM MCU.
- It has *a lot* of in/out pins and it will be probably capable of working on more than
  one bus (same or different type) at the same time.
- Both slave/master role as well as "sniffer" as well as "man-in-the-middle"
  functionalities will be implemented where possible/applicable.
- it will have some common features, but it will certainly differs for some other :)

This device has 31 pins that can be configured in several manner including:
- GPO: up to 31
- GPI: up to 31
- CAN: 1
- I2C: up to 2
- SPI: up to 2
- AN:  up to 10
1 wire protocols might be also implemented.
Parallel-bus/logic analyzer are possible on GPI/GPO pins.
Porting on other MCU of the same family, with more pins and more functions should be
relatively easy :)
